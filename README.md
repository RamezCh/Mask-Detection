# Mask Detection
As part of my apprenticeship at Zaka, I developed a Mask Detection model within a one-week period. This project was designed to apply and reinforce the new technical knowledge and skills I had acquired, providing hands-on experience in real-world problem-solving using computer vision and machine learning techniques.
